**Sankalp – The Habit Tracker That Charges You ₹500 If You Quit**

Most habit apps forgive you when you miss a day.  
Sankalp doesn’t.

You pick 5 habits.  
You commit 100 days.  
You deposit ₹500 upfront.

Miss a single day → your ₹500 is gone forever.  
Complete all 100 days → you get your full ₹500 back + exclusive rewards.

No excuses. No mercy. Just pure accountability.

Sankalp turns your willpower into real skin in the game. Built for people who are tired of lying to themselves and ready to finally become the version they always talk about.

- Zero-tolerance daily check-ins  
- ₹500 real-money commitment (powered by Razorpay)  
- Google OAuth login  
- Burn-your-money-if-you-quit psychology  
- 100-day transformation challenge  
- Winners get refund + bragging rights  

Because talk is cheap.  
But ₹500 isn’t.
